====== Infernal Music ======
Created Friday 31 May 2019

(note: After speaking with Tokey, realised this is more or less the plot of Terry Pratchett's Soul Music)

The party comes to a village, the tavern is packed with patrons and the atmosphere is electric. A band is playing an up tempo and swinging tune. An area has been cleared to make a dance floor with benches and tables turned into a stage, leaving only booths for seating. Some regulars are sat nursing there pints with a pointed disinterest, but much of the village appears to have turned out to listen and dance to the band. The Innkeeper is doing a brisk trade and has laid on extra bar and wait staff to deal with the rush. 

At a break in the set a cleric burst in from outside and inveighs strongly against the immorality of the scene, the dissipation and looseness using thaumaturgy to boost their voice. They get shouted down by the crowd, whose contempt drowns out the magically enhanced exhortation. The cleric leaves defeated but unbowed in a huff. The band starts back up again to a great cheer, some of the regulars in booths take the opportunity to leave, looking sour.

If the party spend the night in the tavern, they hear the band continue playing to the small hours of the morning. Leaving their room later will see fewer and fewer tvern patrons, some of whom will be slumped asleep in booths.
