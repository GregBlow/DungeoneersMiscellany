====== Pact of the blade ======
Created Tuesday 04 June 2019

Name List:

Colwyn
Kemryn

Warlock absconded (flumphed off) with pact weapon, which is an enchanted fey of the patrons court. You are to lure them to a grove that the enchantment may be undone. 

The warlock may carry a charm that prevents them from being influenced by their patron. 

The pact weapon should be quite pleased with the situation, and indeed recommended it (though will dissemble in the patrons presence) 

If sucessful, warlock is transformed into a weapon, the pact weapon is unenchanted and says they'll take it from here, and leaves to ostensibly return to the court.

Reprise: The pact weapon (unenchanted) absconded with the transformed Warlock
